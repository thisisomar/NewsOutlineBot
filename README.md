# NewsOutlineBot

NewsOutlineBot is a Reddit bot I made to deal with article links that lead to paywalls or insanely cluttered pages. This bot uses the [Outline API](https://outline.com)

You can check out the bot in action here - [u/NewsOutlineBot](https://reddit.com/u/NewsOutlineBot)

## Usage
If you'd like to run this yourself, you'll need to set up environment variables (create a .env file in the directory of the project). Below is the template to use:

```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=""
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=""
REDDIT_USERNAME=""
REDDIT_PASSWORD=""
```

You can install all required packages which are in the ```requirements.txt``` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
